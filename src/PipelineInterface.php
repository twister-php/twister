 * middleware to process the incoming request, or to delegate output to another
 * process).
 *
 * Middleware that does not need or desire further processing should not
 * call `$next`, and should instead return a response.
 *
 * For the purposes of Stratigility, `$next` is typically one of either an instance
 * of `Next` or an instance of `NoopFinalHandler`, and, as such, should follow
 * those calling semantics.
